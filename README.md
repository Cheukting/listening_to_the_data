# listening_to_the_data

The workshop with be mainly consists of 3 parts. Which will bring a person with no Python experience to be able to do simple data manipulation with Pandas and visualization with Matplotlib. Participants will be learning by working along with the presenters completing the given exercises.

In the first part, we will help everyone set up and start using Python. We will use Anaconda distribution which is free and provides essential libraries, including Pandas and Matplotlib, and basic IDE like Jupyter Notebook which we will be using in the workshop. After the setup, basic Python coding:how to import a library, common data type (int, float, str, list, etc...), if-else statements, loopings and writing functions will be covered. (~3hrs)

In the second part, we will start teaching Pandas for data manipulation, in this part, a sample dataset in CSV format will be read into a Pandas DataFrame and participants will start to look at the characteristic of the data, cleaning the data and have an idea what useful information the can get from the data. (~1.5hrs)

In the third part, we will used the cleaned data from the previous part and start doing some simple plots using Pandas and Matplotlib. This part starts with explaining what makes a good and bad visualization, after that some matplotlib basic will be covered by some examples. At the end participants will think about what story they can tell with the data and making it into graphs and plots which will serve as the “final project” and concludes the whole workshop. (~1.5hrs)

Notes

Internet connection is essential. The Python version that we are using is Python 3.7. Participates will be required to install the latest Anaconda distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and is recommended to install it before coming to the workshop. Exercises and workshop materials will be hosted on GitHub for download.
